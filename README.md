# Build a Nightlife Coordination App

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://whatsgoinontonight.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

## User Stories
- As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.

- As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.

- As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.

- Story: As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.
